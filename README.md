# QuickClick! - Memory game

## Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project


![Image](https://github.com/Aleeshakara/interactive-frontend/blob/main/assets/images/favicon.png)

This is my first attempt at a interactive website, using Javascript. I chose to design a memory game and I used the "Simon" game as inspiration.

I started project, which can be updated and improved as my knowledge and experience grows.

## UX

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is understanding Javascript by producing an interactive front end memory game. 
### User Stories

#### Developer

>As a developer, I want to:
* Make a website that appeals to many different users
* Showcase my skills as a developer

#### Player

>As a player, I want:
* To see a clear display
* To be able to choose the difficulty of the game
* To hear game sounds
* To see my progress
* A game that beeps and flashes to indicate the sequence
* To see the game rules as i play

### User Goals

* All users want to easily navigate the website
* To play a fun memory game, choose the difficulty and improve over time. 

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create the wireframe for desktop an mobile. 
Please see below:

* [Mobile](https://github.com/Aleeshakara/interactive-frontend/blob/main/Wireframes/QuickClick!-Mobile.pdf) 


## Features

### Existing Features

#### Home Page:
  * Page overlay, which invites players to click to enter
  * QuickClick! game
  * Game instructions

#### Colours

I chose to use black, white, grey, red, green, orange and purple for the game layout. I used brighter colurs for the flashes- fuchsia, orangered, chartreuse, and light coral. I feel it offers a simple look and allowed me to use Javascript to catch the users' attention. 

#### Fonts

The page uses the font Fredoka, as it's fun. I  kept it simple by using Arial for the game rules, as it's a clear easy to read font. 


### Features Left to Implement
* High score page
* Personalised game sounds
* Win/ lose sounds
* Sound on/off option
* Accessibility adjustments (Content Adjustments, Colour & Display Adjustments, Navigation Adjustments)
* Mobile responsiveness


## Technologies used

*	[HTML](https://html.com/)- The main structure of the pages
*	[CSS](https://css-tricks.com)- The overall style
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)- The page interactivity
*	[GitHub](https://github.com)- Used for storing projects
*	[GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io)- Used to commit files to Git
*	[Git](https://git-scm.com)- Used for version control and to push to GitHub
*	[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)- Used to deploy
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)- Used to create wireframes
* [Google Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open)- Used to inspect the codes used
* [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)- Used to parse the CSS and add vendor prefixes


## Testing

### Test Automations

* [Google Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open) was used to view how responsive the website was across different sized devices
* [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.orghttps://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to valiadte the HTML code. Parse error <!DOCTYPE html>... stylesheets should not have HTML synatax
* [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to valiadte the CSS 
### Manual Testing

This website has been tested through a GitPod server, via Code Institute (python3 -m http.server, port 8000)

I have tried my website on Google Chrome and Safari. Both appear to work as expected. 

Devices tested are Samsung Galaxy S20+, Samsung Galaxy S6, iPod Touch, MacBook Air, Samsung Galaxy Tab A, Huawei P30 Lite and iPad 10.2. Not yet responsive for smaller screens.
